Dividing the work for a grievance portal project between two beginner-level engineers over a two-month period requires careful planning and clear task assignments to ensure efficient progress. Here's a suggested plan:

### Project Overview

**Goal:** Develop a grievance portal with sentiment analysis to categorize grievances and prioritize them based on sentiment scores.

### Week-by-Week Plan

#### Week 1: Planning and Setup

**Engineer 1:**
- Set up the development environment (Python, Flask/Django, Git).
- Research and select tools for sentiment analysis (e.g., NLTK, VADER, TextBlob).

**Engineer 2:**
- Gather and define project requirements and create a basic project plan.
- Set up version control (GitHub repository) and initial project structure.

#### Week 2: Backend Development - Grievance Submission

**Engineer 1:**
- Design the database schema for storing grievances, user information, and sentiment scores.
- Implement the backend API for grievance submission.

**Engineer 2:**
- Implement the backend logic for handling grievance submissions and storing data in the database.
- Write unit tests for the submission API.

#### Week 3: Sentiment Analysis Model

**Engineer 1:**
- Collect sample grievance data and preprocess it (cleaning, tokenization).
- Implement a basic sentiment analysis model using a pre-trained library (e.g., VADER).

**Engineer 2:**
- Integrate the sentiment analysis model with the backend.
- Create an API endpoint to analyze grievances and return sentiment scores.

#### Week 4: Frontend Development - Basic Interface

**Engineer 1:**
- Design the frontend layout for the grievance submission form using HTML and CSS.
- Implement the submission form and connect it to the backend API.

**Engineer 2:**
- Develop a simple user interface to display submitted grievances and their sentiment scores.
- Implement client-side form validation and error handling.

#### Week 5: Backend and Frontend Integration

**Engineer 1:**
- Integrate the frontend submission form with the backend API.
- Ensure seamless data flow from frontend to backend and vice versa.

**Engineer 2:**
- Implement functionality to display a list of grievances with their sentiment scores.
- Write integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality.

#### Week 6: Enhancements and Additional Features

**Engineer 1:**
- Implement additional sentiment analysis features (e.g., categorizing grievances into positive, neutral, negative).
- Optimize the model and API for better performance.

**Engineer 2:**
- Add filtering and sorting options on the frontend for grievances based on sentiment.
- Implement a basic admin panel for viewing and managing grievances.

#### Week 7: Testing and Refinement

**Engineer 1:**
- Conduct extensive testing (unit, integration, and system tests) to identify and fix bugs.
- Improve the accuracy and efficiency of the sentiment analysis model.

**Engineer 2:**
- Perform usability testing and gather feedback from potential users.
- Refine the user interface based on feedback and fix UI-related issues.

#### Week 8: Deployment and Documentation

**Engineer 1:**
- Set up a cloud-based deployment environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- Deploy the backend and frontend to the cloud platform.

**Engineer 2:**
- Write comprehensive documentation for the project, including setup instructions, API documentation, and user guides.
- Create a presentation/demo to showcase the project to stakeholders.

### Task Distribution

**Engineer 1:**
- Focus on backend development, database design, API creation, sentiment analysis integration, and deployment.
- Ensure the technical infrastructure is robust and secure.

**Engineer 2:**
- Focus on frontend development, user interface design, integration with backend APIs, and usability improvements.
- Ensure the user experience is smooth and intuitive.

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Daily Stand-ups:** Short meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
- **Weekly Review:** Review progress, set goals for the next week, and adjust the plan as needed.
- **Pair Programming:** Occasionally work together on complex tasks to enhance learning and collaboration.
- **Version Control:** Use GitHub to manage code, track changes, and facilitate code reviews.

By clearly dividing the tasks and maintaining consistent communication, the two beginner-level engineers can efficiently complete the grievance portal project within the two-month timeframe.
